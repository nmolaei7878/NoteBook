# Vanila-JS & Dom Maniupulation

- Dom and HTML file are not exactly the same
- you can write html files without head and body.(DOM will inject them on the fly for you).
- when DOM see the first visible content in html file it start with body and your html to the DOM.
- you can see your DOM in browser element tab.
- you can see your HTML file in viewSource tab.
